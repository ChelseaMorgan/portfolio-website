                    <p>Mentr can stand apart from market competition by offering the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Individualized 1-on-1 sessions, focusing on the potential to form ongoing mentor-mentee relationships.</li>

                    <h2>Initial Sitemap &amp; Card Sorting</h2>
                    <p>Using my user flows, I created an initial sitemap to help visualize how the information architecture of Mentr would look. Initially, I had sorted all of my potential screens into 4 main categories, but I would need to confirm with potential users that this structure made sense.</p>
                    <p>So, in order to collect feedback about my information architecture, I conducted open card sort with 6 participants in which they sorted 28 cards into their own categories.</p>

                    <h3>Findings</h3>
                    <p>The card sort revealed the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Participants created a total of 37 categories, with a median of 5 categories each</li>
                        <li>50% of participants created 5 categories</li>
                        <li>17% of participants created 6 categories</li>
                        <li>17% of participants created 7 categories</li>
                        <li>17% of participants created 9 categories</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It was clear from the card sort that most users felt my information architecture should span at least 5 categories, rather than the 4 I had initially mapped out. Using that information, I then revised my sitemap accordingly.</p>

                        <p>Analysis of my usability test data via affinity mapping and use of a rainbow spreadsheet revealed that I would need to make some major changes to my information architecture and overall organization of Mentr. Additionally, data suggested that I would need to make some other minor changes to iconography and terminology to improve the clarity of certain features within the app, and to reduce the cognitive load on the user as they're learning to navigate the app for the first time.</p>
                        <p>Check out my top 2 highest priority issues below, and the changes I made to fix them.</p>

                    <p>Once the major usability issues were resolved, it was time to begin designing the final high-fidelity screens in Figma.</p>
                    <p>However, I wanted to first establish what type of "look and feel" users preferred from the get-go. This way, I would have a solid starting point based on user feedback before designing the rest of Mentr's screens. This would also prevent me from having to re-design the whole app's UI later on if it turned out that users didn't like my choices.</p>

                    <p>After performing my preference tests and receiving feedback, I now had a strong foundation to build upon as I designed the high-fidelity versions of the rest of my screens.</p>
                    <p>As I learned more about the principles of UI design, I continued to improve upon my UI elements accordingly. Throughout this process, I developed a color palette based on principles of emotional design, made changes to my UI elements based on best practices and guidelines from established design systems (e.g., Material Design), and ultimately created a design language for Mentr, which I've continued to add to and improve upon as my designs have evolved.</p>

                        <h2>High-Fidelity Prototype &amp; Collaboration</h2>
                        <p>As my high-fidelity screens and overall design system continued to evolve, I wanted to ensure I had at least one other set of eyes to look over my designs and provide feedback from a different perspective than my own. I posted my design to a community of other UX design students via Slack and had 5 other students provide feedback on my designs in exchange for feedback on their designs.</p>
                        <p>This design collaboration and peer review process was integral in identifying issues I had essentially gone "blind" to as the sole designer of Mentr and in taking the necessary steps to correct them.</p>
                        <p>However, while this exercise was certainly helpful in collecting feedback to implement from other designers, it was also incredibly valuable for me in learning to defend my design decisions for the feedback I chose not to implement.</p>
                        <p>Below you'll find some of the design decisions I made, and more importantly, why.</p>

                        <h2>Designing for Accessibility</h2>
                        <p>With a background in the field of medical rehabilitation prior to my training in UX design, I've learned how important accessibility is for both the physical and digital products we use in everyday life.</p>
                        <p>In this section of the course, I began to familiarize myself with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and discovered the ways in which my current design could be improved to meet those standards. Take a look at some of the preliminary changes I made to improve the inclusivity of my designs.</p>
                        <p>Future directions for Mentr will involve a much deeper analysis of accessibility standards and with it, more complex improvements.</p>

                                <li>Replaced placeholder text within text field with permanent labels above text field so that the informative text does not disappear once a user goes to type in the text field; used placeholder text only as supplemental example text for users to refer to.</li>
                                <li>Added a darker stroke around text fields to increase contrast of element against background color in order to improve visibility of text fields.</li>

                    <p>As a designer, I am always striving to improve my designs as I continue to learn and grow my knowledge and skill-set within the field. With that, I've created a list of next steps for Mentr should I have the time and resources to invest in the future:</p>

                <p>Designing Mentr from the ground up has been beyond valuable in my development and growth as newcomer to the field of UX design. Throughout this journey, I've learned the intricate dance between user needs and innovative solutions, the art of balancing aesthetics with functionality, and above all, the paramount importance of empathy in good design.</p>
                <p>These lessons and skills I've gained through the creation of Mentr will serve as a solid foundation to build upon as I continue to learn and gain experience as a UX designer.</p>
